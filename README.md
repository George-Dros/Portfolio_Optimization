# Portfolio Optimization and Efficient Frontier Analysis

This project explores portfolio optimization techniques to find the best risk-return trade-offs for a set of financial assets. Using Python, we calculate and visualize the efficient frontier, Max Sharpe Ratio (MSR) portfolio, Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio, and the Capital Market Line (CML). This analysis is an essential component of modern portfolio theory and is widely used in financial analysis and investment management.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
1. Gathered and cleaned stock data.
2. Calculated annualized expected returns and the covariance matrix of returns.
3. Constructed and visualized the efficient frontier.
4. Identified and plotted the Max Sharpe Ratio (MSR) and Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolios.
5. Plotted the Capital Market Line (CML) to show the optimal risk-return profile for a given risk-free rate.

This project provides a foundational look into portfolio optimization techniques, commonly used in quantitative finance.
